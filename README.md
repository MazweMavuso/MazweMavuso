## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate and detail-oriented **Full Stack Developer** with experience in building modern, responsive websites and applications using technologies like **PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, HTML/CSS**, and frameworks such as **CodeIgniter**.

Beyond coding, I bring hands-on experience in **hardware and network troubleshooting**, and I’ve worked as an **Inventory Manager** for MTN MoMo POS devices.

I’m driven to build tech solutions that solve real-world problems—most recently through **SkillLink**, a job and tender matching platform for Eswatini. I believe in using technology to empower communities and create opportunity.
